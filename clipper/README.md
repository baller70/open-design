# Open Design Web Clipper (MV3 — Chrome · Edge · Firefox)

The **Open Design Web Clipper**: a browser extension that captures images,
screenshots, and page content from any site straight into your Open Design
**Library** (the global asset registry).

This is a **standalone subproject** — it is intentionally *not* part of the pnpm
workspace and has **no build step**. The files here load directly as an unpacked
extension. The daemon/web TypeScript boundaries are unaffected.

## Load it

1. Start Open Design locally (`pnpm tools-dev`) so the daemon is listening on
   `http://127.0.0.1:7456` (the default; change it under **Advanced** in the
   popup if you used a different `--daemon-port`).
2. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**,
   and select this `clipper/` directory.
   - **Edge:** same steps at `edge://extensions`.
   - **Firefox:** `about:debugging` → *This Firefox* → *Load Temporary Add-on* →
     pick `manifest.json` (or run `npx web-ext run --source-dir clipper`).

That's it — **no pairing, no codes, no tokens**. The popup shows
**● Connected** as soon as it detects Open Design running, and you can capture
right away.

> The manifest carries a cross-browser background block
> (`service_worker` for Chrome/Edge, `scripts` for Firefox) plus
> `browser_specific_settings.gecko` for AMO. Chrome logs a harmless
> "unrecognized key `background.scripts`" warning on dev load — it runs normally,
> and store users never see it. Store/ASO assets and per-store copy live in
> [`store/`](store/LISTING.md).

### Why no login?

The daemon only listens on loopback (`127.0.0.1`), so only programs on your own
machine can reach it, and a web page can't impersonate this extension's
`chrome-extension://` origin. The daemon auto-trusts that origin for the
`/api/library/*` routes, which is everything the clipper uses. Zero setup,
nothing to misconfigure.

## Capture

- **Popup** → *Capture page → Library* (a self-contained, high-fidelity HTML
  snapshot — readable stylesheets inlined, images inlined as data URIs, scripts
  stripped), *Download Figma (.json)* (a structured Figma capture you can import
  with the OD Figma plugin — see `../figma-plugin/`), *Pick element → capture*,
  *Pick images*, or *Capture screenshot* (visible tab).
- **Pick element** → a DevTools-style picker: hover to highlight any element,
  click to save it as a **screenshot cropped to that element plus its outerHTML
  and metadata** (tag, selector, size). Esc cancels. The saved Library card is an
  image whose preview also exposes the element's HTML.
- **Pick images** → an on-page overlay grid of every image on the page with
  checkboxes, *Select all* / *Clear*, and *Save N to Library* — so you choose
  exactly which images to save instead of grabbing them all.
- **On-page toolbar** → an optional floating 📄 / ✦ / 📸 / 🖼️ / 🎯 launcher
  anchored **top-center** of the page (Figma-style), with a gap from the edge so
  it reads as a deliberate surface. It's **hidden by default**; turn it on with
  *Show on-page bar* in the popup (the preference is remembered, and the bar's
  ✕ hides it again). Each control shows a **hover tooltip** naming what it does.
  Grab the dotted **handle** on its left edge to drag the bar anywhere on the
  page — its position is remembered across reloads. The launcher is automatically
  pulled out of frame while a capture is taken, so it never ends up inside the
  snapshot.
- **Right-click an image** → *Save image to Open Design Library*.

### Page → Figma

*Capture page → Library* also computes an **OD Figma capture** (a JSON node-tree
of frames / text / images with live geometry, fills, strokes, corner radii and
shadows) from the live page and stores it alongside the HTML asset. From the
Library you can later **Download Figma** for that asset, or use *Download Figma
(.json)* in the clipper to grab it directly without saving to the Library. Both
files import into Figma via the companion **OD Figma plugin** (`../figma-plugin/`).

> A native binary `.fig` can't be produced outside Figma, so the "Figma file" is
> an importable JSON node-tree rebuilt as editable layers by the OD Figma plugin.
> Fidelity is best-effort: cross-origin stylesheets that block reads, web-component
> shadow DOM, and tainted canvases may degrade.

Everything you capture appears in the Library tab (live, via SSE) with a
**Clipper** source badge and a back-link to its source page.

The **Capture options** (under *Advanced*) include *Inline images* — on by
default for the highest fidelity; turn it off for smaller, faster captures that
reference images by URL instead of embedding them.

## Permissions

- `host_permissions: <all_urls>` — needed to screenshot/read images on any page,
  fetch+inline cross-origin page resources, and reach the loopback daemon.
  Standard for web clippers (Evernote, Figma).
- `scripting`, `tabs` — capture the active tab, harvest images, and run the
  page-capture runtime (`capture.js`) on demand.
- `contextMenus` — the right-click "Save image" entry.
- `downloads` — save the *Download Figma (.json)* file to disk.
- `storage` — remember the daemon URL locally (only needed if you changed it).
